preprocess_data.py: Python script that does the data preprocesing - Parses the provided data files - Runs Principal Component Analysis on the entire data set - Plots various charts related to the Principal Component Analysis - Filters out the wanted time intervals - Interpolates or removes the missing data values - Saves the processed data into a sepearte file for future use

train_data.R: R script that trains multiple Hidden Markov Models - Loads the data filtered by the preprocessing script - Splits the normal data into training and testing data sets - Trains 21 models with states in the range 4â€“24 - Plots a graph of the normalized log likelihood of each model on both the
training and testing data sets - Plots a graph of the Bayesian Information Criterion values for each model

anomaly_predict.R: R script that predicts anomalies with trained models - Loads the data filtered by the preprocessing script - Tests the trained model on each interval of the testing and anomalous
data individually to find the log likelihood of each interval - Plots a graph showing the distribution of log likelihoods for individual
time intervals of the test and all three anomaly data sets - Calculates the optimal log likelihood threshold for anomalies given some
context about the value of false positives and false negatives

point_anomalies.R: R script that finds threshold values for point anomalies - Loads the data filtered by the preprocessing script - From the training data finds the average of each minute in the interval,
this is an average normal interval - Then calculate the average difference between the average of each normal
interval and the anomaly observation - Use this information to find thresholds for point anomalies from the testing dataset,
because we don't know the actual number of point anomalies in the testing dataset, we have
to make a guess. - Find point anomalies by comparing the difference value to the thresholds with
the anomaly datasets.
